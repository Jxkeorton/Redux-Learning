# React Redux full course

This React Redux Full Course for Beginners is a complete tutorial full of 4 hours of React and Redux Toolkit code and instruction to help you learn state management with Redux. Think of this React Redux full course tutorial as a video textbook with 7 clearly defined chapters.

## What i learned

- App Structure & Data Flow
- Async Logic & Thunks
- Blog Project
- Performance Optimizations
- RTK Query Project
- Advanced Redux & RTK Query

I am glad to have taken this course, it will aid in future updgrades for my app that is currently on the app store since the state is not currently being handled all that great.
